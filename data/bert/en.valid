A subject may not actually believe q , for example , regardless of whether he or she is justified or warranted . Thus , one might instead say that knowledge is closed under " known " deduction : if , while knowing p , S believes q because S knows that p entails q , then S knows q . An even stronger formulation would be as such : If , while knowing various propositions , S believes p because S knows that these propositions entail p , then S knows p . While the principle of epistemic closure is generally regarded as intuitive , philosophers such as Robert Nozick and Fred Dretske have argued against it .

RT Aurigae is an F to G type Classical Cepheid variable which varies from magnitude + 5.00 to + 5.82 with a period of 3.728309 days . The variability was discovered in 1905 . It was quickly recognised as a member of the class of Cepheid variables , but their nature was not understood at that time . Radial velocity changes were detected corresponding to the brightness variations , but the idea that these were caused by stellar pulsations and temperature changes was largely dismissed in favour of orbital motions of a binary star . More accurate observations eventually proved beyond doubt that the brightness variations were caused by pulsations in the atmospheres of the stars , with the stars being smallest and hottest near maximum brightness .

Evidence in a policy debate competition ( sometimes referred to as " cards " ) consists mainly of two parts . The " cite " contains all relevant citation information ( that is , the author , date of publication , journal , title , etc . ) . Although every card should contain a complete citation , only the author 's name and date of publication are typically spoken aloud in a speech . Some teams will also read the author 's qualifications if they wish to emphasize this information . The " body " is a fragment of the author 's original text . The length of a body can vary greatly - cards can be as short as a few sentences and as long as two or more pages . Most cards are between one and five paragraphs in length . The body of a card is often underlined or highlighted in order to eliminate unnecessary or redundant sentences when the card is read in a round . In a round , the tagline , the debater 's summary of the evidence , is read first , followed by the cite and the body .

While the larger Presbyterian Church was a mix of Scottish and English Presbyterians , several smaller Presbyterian groups were almost entirely Scottish Seceders , and they displayed the process of assimilation into the broader American religious culture . Fisk ( 1968 ) traces the history of the Associate Reformed Church in the Old Northwest from its formation by a union of Associate and Reformed Presbyterians in 1782 to the merger of this body with the Seceder bodies to form the United Presbyterian Church in 1858 . It became the Associate Reformed Synod of the West and remained centered in the Midwest . It withdrew from the parent body in 1820 because of Confessional disagreements regarding the administration of sacraments . The Associate Reformed Synod of the West maintained the characteristics of an immigrant church with Scottish roots , emphasized the Westminster Standards , used only the Psalms in public worship , was Sabbatarian and was strongly abolitionist and anti-Catholic . In the 1850s however , it exhibited evidence of assimilation . It showed greater ecumenical interest , greater interest in the evangelization of the West and of the cities , and a declining interest in maintaining the unique characteristics of its Scotch-Irish past .

If the dilation of the aorta progresses to a significant-diameter aneurysm , causes a dissection or a rupture , or leads to failure of the aortic or other valve , then surgery ( possibly a composite aortic valve graft or valve-sparing aortic root replacement ) becomes necessary . Although aortic graft surgery ( or any vascular surgery ) is a serious undertaking it is generally successful if undertaken on an elective basis . Surgery in the setting of acute aortic dissection or rupture is considerably more problematic . Elective aortic valve / graft surgery is usually considered when aortic root diameter reaches , but each case needs to be specifically evaluated by a qualified cardiologist . New valve-sparing surgical techniques are becoming more common . As people with Marfan syndrome live longer , other vascular repairs are becoming more common , e.g. , repairs of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms and aneurysms of vessels other than the aorta .

Bloom is a test to measure the strength of a gel or gelatin . The test was originally developed and patented in 1925 by Oscar T. Bloom . The test determines the weight in grams needed by a specified plunger ( normally with a diameter of 0.5 inch ) to depress the surface of the gel by 4 mm without breaking it at a specified temperature . The number of grams is called the Bloom value , and most gelatins are between 30 and 300 g Bloom . The higher a Bloom value , the higher the melting and gelling points of a gel , and the shorter its gelling times . This method is most often used on soft gels . To perform the Bloom test on gelatin , a 6.67 % gelatin solution is kept for 17-18 hours at 10 Â° C prior to being tested .

" Shangri-La " became an international music sensation , especially catching the attention of many youths in Asia .

The laboratories , which were in use from 1907 to 1947 , occupied three floors . They were overseen ( for all but the last three years ) by the physical chemist David Chapman , a college fellow from 1907 to 1944 . At the time of their closure , they were the last college-based science laboratories at the university . They were named the Sir Leoline Jenkins laboratories , after the former principal of the college . The laboratories led to scientific research and tuition ( particularly in chemistry ) becoming an important part of the college 's academic life . The brochure produced for the opening ceremony noted that the number of science students at the college had increased rapidly in recent years , and that provision of college laboratories would assist the tuition of undergraduates , as well as attracting to Jesus College graduates of the University of Wales who wished to continue their research at Oxford . The laboratories became unnecessary when the university began to provide centralised facilities for students ; they were closed in 1947 . The college then converted the laboratories ( along with other rooms in the buildings adjoining Ship Street ) into further accommodation for students and fellows , as well as relocating the Meyricke Library and providing a separate library for Celtic studies .

" Pyrodinium " is able to grow with nitrate and urea as nitrogen sources , but has low tolerance to ammonia . " Pyrodinium " cannot grow with alanine , arginine , or histidine as nitrogen sources , indicating limited ability to assimilate organic nitrogen . Maximum growth rates and chlorophyll levels are observed when nitrogen levels are greater than 100 Î¼M . Toxin production remains constant when nitrate is between 60 and 500 Î¼M . Since toxin production remains constant even at nitrogen levels limiting to growth , toxin production must play an important role within " Pyrodinium " cells . However , the toxin profile ( i.e. which PSTs are produced ) changes under varying growth conditions , so nutrient conditions may affect toxicity .

In the early 20th century , many composers , including Rachmaninoff , Richard Strauss , Giacomo Puccini , and Edward Elgar , continued to work in forms and in a musical language that derived from the 19th century . However , modernism in music became increasingly prominent and important ; among the most important modernists were Alexander Scriabin , Claude Debussy , and post-Wagnerian composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss , who experimented with form , tonality and orchestration . Busoni , Stravinsky , Schoenberg , and Schreker were already recognized before 1914 as modernists , and Ives was retrospectively also included in this category for his challenges to the uses of tonality . Composers such as Ravel , Milhaud , and Gershwin combined classical and jazz idioms .

An institutional repository has been understood as a means to ensure that the published work of scholars is available to the academic community even after increases in subscription fees or budget cuts within libraries . The majority of research scholars do not provide free access to their research output to their colleagues in an organization . Institutional repositories provide scholars with a common platform so that everyone in the institution can contribute scholarly material to promote cross-campus interdisciplinary research . The development of an institutional repository redefines the production and dissemination of scholarly material within an academic community . The contents available on the institute 's website usually are removed after a few weeks . An institutional repository can provide a platform to manage institutional information , including web content . Institutional repositories have a number of benefits , including access to resources , visibility of research , and presentations of the contents .

Most of the remaining walls were 1 foot high or less and of dry-set flint and chalk . They were only 1 foot to 1 foot 6 inches in width ( with offsets ) in shallow foundation trenches . The excavator thought that the upper part of the walls were probably made of wychert , a local building material still existing in some buildings particularly at Haddenham and consisting of chalk mud mixed with straw which would set very solid . The roofs may have been partly thatched but part must have been tiled , because a fair number of roofing tiles were found spread over the site . Looking at the building from the church side , the excavator thought that on the left was probably a two-storey building which would have been the accommodation reserved for the lord of the manor . The room on the first floor would have been the " great chamber " serving as bedroom and sitting room . The great hall probably extended in front of this part of the building towards the church , but this was not found or excavated . On the right of this room was probably the kitchen and beyond that more living accommodation , perhaps for the steward , with a smaller hall extending in front of it . This was roughly in the centre of the building . The excavator considered whether this might be the great hall but thought it probably too small . Beyond it to the right was a range of single storey rooms .
